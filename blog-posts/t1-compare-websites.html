        <p class="text_pos_blog"><!--tech blog here --> -One website that I cannot stop myself from compulsively checking is ESPN.com. I'm a huge sports fan and ESPN has become the default place to get my sports fix. Sometimes my mind wanders and I find myself searching ESPN unconsciously. It's a problem. Beyond the 24 hour sports news cycle that is constantly updated on the site, its HTML structure and CSS formatting are very well designed. The top of the website has the unmistakable ESPN logo and characteristic red hue--ESPN's branding is impeccable. At the very top, there is a menu that allows you to view the local ESPN sites for various cities, and beneath that there is a running scoreboard for various sports that you can toggle through. The main body has a large playable video and links to recent headlines to the right. The problem that the design team tackled was likely "how can we present users sports stories in an efficient manner that allows them to quickly filter the content based on their given interests."By having accessible tabs for each sport, many different forms of media readily available, and an easy to manipulate index, I think ESPN.com succeeded in their goal, evidenced by my compulsion to keep returning.
        -Another website that I check far too often is Facebook. Again, their branding is well done with the familiar Facebook color scheme and logo visible throughout. I think the main problem that Facebook was trying to tackle was "How can we efficiently present users content that is relevant to their social lives, and encourage them to visit our website and share often?" Facebook succeeds in their design goals by displaying notifications on the homepage and header--making it irrestible for users to check what their new notifications might be--and by having reel of content posted by friends and other interests that scrolls down infinitely. On the very top of the reel, Facebook makes it easy for users to share content by simply filling in a box that asks them "What's on your mind?" and submitting. After submitting, your content instantly becomes part of the content reel, making users feel connected to everything else in their reel, and in essence, the world.
        -YouTube makes money by getting users to watch videos, which are often preceded by commercials. Their design problem, then, was most likely addresses the question, "How can we get users to watch as many videos as possible?" YouTube tackles this problem by presenting videos on their front page that are related to videos you've watched, recommended for you, or--at the very top-- deemed "popular on YouTube." In essence, they are presenting you videos that may be valuable to you, based on what other users have been watching or from you historical preferences. Once you watch a video, they are very clever in immediately presenting 12 related videos in the viewer in addition to the videos already on the right-hand menu, making it easy to watch video after video that fits your mood and tastes. From experience, their design is very effective, and the clean white background on the website allows the videos to stand-out and maintain the viewer's focus. </p>
