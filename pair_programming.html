            <h3>Why Pairing?</h3>
                <p>Pairing is a collaborative process between DBC'ers where two individuals
                of varying strengths are able to work together to accomplish a common goal.</p>
            <h3>How to pair</h3>
                <p>Usually there will be one person driving and the other will be navigating.<br />
                    The driver is the person who actually works at the keyboard.<br />
                    The navigator guides the driver and has the big picture view of the project.

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>I'm still getting used to occupying the roles of driver and navigator--it's hard not to want to type something in when navigating rather than explaining it, and it's equally difficult to stay focused on what the navigator is saying when driving--but with each pairing session I think I'm improving. In my GPS, we alternated roles whenever appropriate on the fly, and for challenge 5 since I was having trouble dealing with screensharing and updating the HTML page and using devtools at the same time, I mostly navigated. I still have a lot to improve, but I'm looking forward to getting better with each of my pairs.
