      The reason my blog from week 1 faltered when the size of the window changed was mainly due to its lack of responsive design. When I first wrote the code, the result looked perfect in the window that it was in, but when I actually loaded the website to github it didn't adjust well to a larger screen. The spacing was out of whack, text hugged the extreme sides of screens, and it was mostly due to overusage of pixel sizing and floats. This challenge was helpful in learning to convert to a responsive website, and I will apply it to my blog!
