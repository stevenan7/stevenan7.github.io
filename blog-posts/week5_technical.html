        <p class="text_pos_blog"><!--tech blog here --> Instance variables are always prefaced witha  @, and class variables are always preceded by @@. Instance variables belong to an object, or in other words an instance of a class. However, class variables are also known as static member variables, because there is only one copy of a class variable that is shared with all instances of that class. Instance variables are useful if you want a variable to change over different iterations, like say you want a function to calculate sales taxes in different states and the variable needs to change. Class variables are useful if you want to make sure a variable doesn't change in your program. For example, a class variable might be useful to define something that is static like the hours in a day. If only some days--especially sunday nights during phase0-- had 25!

        <p class="text_pos_blog"><!-- culture blog here-->It's been fun getting to know other DBCers and struggling through challenges with them, and I'm glad that DBC has a focus on pair programming. So far I've always felt that my partners have had more technical prowess than me, but maybe that is a self-conscious attitude that everyone tends to have going into a situation where no one is sure where their skills are at in comparison. I've gotten only positive feedback and I've become sort of competitive in making sure my meta-feedback is rated as specific, actionable, and kind. Seeing the meta-feedback has definitely been a good motivator for me to give solid feedback. <br> Pairing has mostly been fun, but I am still adjusting to focusing on the code while accomodating the needs and ideas of my partner. When I engage with something as intellectually stimulating as writing challenging code, I really need to focus and get into a flow to do my best work, and I'm working at finding that rhythm with each of my pairs. I often find myself worrying too much what my pair is thinking to the point that it interferes with my ability to focus on the task. I've found that pairing has been helpful at bringing out ideas and seeing problems from different angles, but my best breakthroughs have usually come immediately after a pairing session when I have a chance to digest the session on my own. It would be great if those breakthroughs could come while in the pairing session, and I will have to work on getting into a flow with a wide variety of skills and personalities.
