        <p class="text_pos_blog"><!-- culture blog here-->A problem in tech that I experienced while working as a middle school teacher was fighting the stereotypes about programmers and jobs in tech. For one, most girls at my school opted out of taking the elective computer science classes. They view it as a male thing-- either too nerdy or too much math for them to approach-- and as a result there were maybe only 5 girls out of the 30 students in the CS class. The boys that do sign up also have a warped view of what a tech career constitutes. Too many times I've heard young boys interested only in creating the next "snapchat" and reaching instant fame and fortune. Both of these perceptions can be managed by implementing a computer science program in as early as middle school that focuses on the creative and dynamic side of learning a coding language and writing programs. If girls are able to see that learning Ruby, is in many ways like learning French or Spanish, the nerdy math-oriented perception of coding may be replaced and interest more girls. If boys are able to see how many things can be created using code, and that it is a medium that is constantly changing, perhaps they will invest deeper and view it as something that if they are to be successful, they will have to continue to work on it their entire lives. While these are general recommendations, I'm looking forward to seeing how tech and computer science progresses in public schools and it sure will be exciting to have the skills to be at the forefront.
